# AVseparation

The above files are supplementary materials to the paper "Audio-Visual Based Online Multi-Source Separation"

Experiment summary:- 

**Scenario 1x** are near-field examples. \\
**Scenario 2** is a far-field example.

**Scenario 1A**: Speakers are talking and walking simultaneously toward the audio-visual sensors. \
**Scenario 1B**: Scenario with time-varying number of moving speakers. \
**Scenario 1C**: Scenario with loud background noise. \
**Scenario 2**: Speakers are talking and walking simultaneously toward the audio-visual sensors. \
**Ablation**: The measurements, tracking and separation are performed using the audio data only. \


Folder description:-

**Supplementary Materials**: Includes the folders below:-\
**Ablation(audio-only)**: Includes the mixture signal, clean and estimated source signals (in .wav format) from Scenario 1A and Scenario 2.\
**Audio-Visual_combined**: Includes videos and audio files of the mixture signal, clean and estimated source signals from Scenario 1A, 1B, 1C, 2. The videos also contain the estimates from the MS-GLMB tracker that are projected onto the images as bounding boxes, where the colour of each bounding box denotes the label for each source.
