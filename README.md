# AVseparation

The above files are supplementary materials to the paper "Audio-Visual Based Online Multi-Source Separation"

Experiment summary:- 

**Scenario A**: The human speakers are situated closer to the audio-visual sensors.\
**Scenario B**: The human speakers are situated farther away from the audio-visual sensors.\
**Ablation**: The measurements, tracking and separation are performed using the audio data only.

Folder description:-

**Supplementary Materials**: Includes clean source signals from Scenario A and B and the folders below.\
**Ablation(audio-only)**: Includes the mixture signals and estimated source signals (in .wav format) from Scenario A and Scenario B.\
**Audio-Visual_combined**: Includes videos of the mixture and estimated source signals (in .mp4 format) from Scenario A and Scenario B. The videos also contain the estimates from the MS-GLMB tracker that are projected onto the images as bounding boxes, where the colour of each bounding box denotes the label for each source.
